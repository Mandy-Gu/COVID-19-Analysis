# covid19 panel data

This work converts the excellent data collection on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [from Keystone Strategy](https://github.com/Keystone-Strategy/covid19-intervention-data), and creates a panel matching it to the infections/deaths 
data available from the New York Times [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/6cb66d9a821ce8225f6f9ffcb77ce6db9889c14c). 

The below is copied from the Keystone Readme:
