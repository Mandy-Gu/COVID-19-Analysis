# Modeling
Our team has decided to build linear regression model bacause of its great interpretability.

## Modeling process
We have built two linear regression models to predict infection rate and death rate separately using the independent variables regarding education, medical resource, public transportation, social distancing, aging and population density.

### Modeling results
![Model Features Coefficients and P-value](https://github.com/Mandy-Gu/COVID-19-Analysis/blob/master/model_feature_coef.png?raw=true)
From the model results, we have identified three factors, aging index, gathering ban(one index for social distancing) and education level, that have relatively high coefficient and are statically significant.
## Recommendations and Insights
Our team found that stricter gathering ban policy would effectively lower the infection rate especially in the early stage when the virus is not eidely spread. Meanwhile, the more population is occupied by elder people, the higher the infection rate will be. This is reasonable because it is proved that old people are more likely to be infected.

Surprisingly, we also found that there's a strong correlation education level and infection rate. Regions with high education level tend to have lower infection rate.

Thus, we recommend that countries or regions where the pandemic is not particularly serious should also release stricter policy about social gathering. Besides, they should also pay more attention to regions with lower education level and give more resources to regions with more elders.
